In the SAB regional league, current log leaders are Friendly City from Alicedale, with Makhanda top side Maru FC sitting comfortably in the second spot on the log.  The log leaders sit on 24 points after 12 games, while Maru FC sits on 21 points with a game on hand. Maru FC will have to win convincingly to close the gap and reclaim their top spot since the first round of fixtures.Jacaranda Aces seem to have now turned the corner after an abysmal start to their campaign. Abachathazi are currently lying fifth on the log with 16 points after 12 games and are also enjoying a rich vein of form as they have won their last two games. City Pirates started well but are now struggling a bit and they are lying seventh in an eight-team stream and have 14 points – 3 more than Alexandria-based Golden Chiefs, who are rock bottom on the log, having played the same number of games with City Pirates. It will take a lot of hard work and discipline for City Pirates to avoid the drop to the LFA in their season of promotion with only three games left. Maru will host Bathurst City on Saturday, 25 February, in a lunchtime kick-off while Jacaranda Aces lock horns with Port Alfred-based Mighty Forest in a 3 pm kick-off.  On the other hand, Makana LFA competition’s officer, Akona Heshu, announced that all Stream A weekend fixtures in the Premier division had been postponed. Still, Stream B fixtures will go ahead as scheduled.
